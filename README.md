#BetterDad
Final project by Indima, Dev, Connolly, and Pete.
 

Parenting is a very hectic and busy. There are practices, playdates, and activities. More often than not there is always one parent that shoulders the responsibilities of dropping off as well as picking up. Wouldnâ€™t it be nice to have something where the whole family is informed  of the activates for the day?  
Well better dad does just that! We use a calendar and to do list to help parents remember their tasks for the day. Each family will have an account. Each family account are individual accounts that have been linked together. Parent accounts will be the admins and will have to ability to add remove from the calendar. 
 Adding appointments to the calendar you are able to designate the parent who will be handling transportation it. Once a parent or child is added to an event they are alerted by SMS of the new event they will also receive  reminders on the day of and one hour before the event.

The  to do list of the app can have items added by Both parent and child, but only the parents can remove items from the todo list. The to do list can serve multiple functions. Each task added again can be assigned to specific members of the family. Here parents can add chores and allowance amount for the chore. This way the children have a set list of chores and it also keeps track of the Allowance for the parents for each child. The kids can also post to the to do list that can be added to the calendar by parents. So if your child volunteers you for a bake sale they can add the date time event as well as the item to bake to the to do list and the parents will be notified  and then can add that task to the calendar.
